# WeatherPlus

A weather app that makes you aware of climate change and offers tailored tips and proposals to fight climate change - be it in your neighborhood or around the globe.

Many people aren't aware of what impact climate change has on their daily lives. Live goes on, even if the poles are melting and the sea levels are rising. WeatherPlus, on first glance, is just another weather app, but with a twist: It regularly displays concrete information regarding climate change, extreme weather and environmental issues in your area. In contrary to other websites and apps which provide information about climate change, WeatherPlus always makes sure that all problems are directly related to the user's daily live.

All warnings include clear information on
- what to look out for
- what exactly the problem is about
- what the user can do right now.

Users can discuss weather and climate problems with other users by posting comments and images.

Air pollution warnings provide further insights into the pollution caused by coal power plants.
Actions to write to politicians and the operator are supported out of the box.
